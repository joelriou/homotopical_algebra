# homotopical_algebra

Formalisation of Quillen's homotopical algebra (model categories, etc.), localization of categories (towards the fundamental lemma of homotopical algebra, and also localization of triangulated categories).

Get the code using `leanproject get joelriou/homotopical_algebra`.

The fundamental lemma of homotopical algebra appears in `src/for_mathlib/algebraic_topology/homotopical_algebra/fundamental_lemma.lean`.

The localization results for triangulated categories are obtained in `src/for_mathlib/category_theory/localization/triangulated_subcategory.lean`.
